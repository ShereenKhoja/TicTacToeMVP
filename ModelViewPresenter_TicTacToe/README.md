### Notes on TextUI

TextUI simulates an event driven Text User Interface.  This is done because
we are using SDL (an event driver GUI) as our other UI.  

Matching UI styles makes the Model/View/Presenter separation more clear and
more consistent.

In reality, TextUI is a simple simulation of a UI and not usable in the
real world.
